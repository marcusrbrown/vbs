# VBS (View By Stardate)

> A modern, local-first Star Trek chronological viewing guide that helps fans track their progress through all series and movies in chronological order by in-universe stardate.

VBS is built with TypeScript and Vite using functional factory patterns with closures for state management. The application features a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 chronological eras from the 22nd-32nd centuries (1,000+ years of Star Trek history), with persistent progress tracking using browser LocalStorage and planned migration to IndexedDB.

The architecture emphasizes type safety through advanced TypeScript generics, generic EventEmitter systems for inter-module communication, and modern ES modules. All viewing progress is stored locally with export/import capabilities for data portability.
