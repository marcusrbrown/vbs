# Star Trek Chronological Viewing Guide by Stardate

**Restated Prompt:** Create a comprehensive guide for watching *Star Trek* series and films in stardate (in-universe chronological) order. Cover all series (from **The Original Series** through the latest streaming shows like *Strange New Worlds* and *Lower Decks*). Explain how the stardate system changes across series, highlight important story continuity, and provide viewing notes for casual fans (while making the guide suitable as an assistant reference).

The various *Star Trek* crews span centuries of “future” time.  For example, *The Original Series* (2260s) uses stardates roughly **1,300–6,000** [oai_citation:0‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=four%20digits%20weren%27t%20selected%20quite,in%20the%20rate%20of%20change), whereas *The Next Generation* (2360s) begins at about **41,000** [oai_citation:1‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=four%20digits%20weren%27t%20selected%20quite,in%20the%20rate%20of%20change) [oai_citation:2‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2364%20%2041000%E2%80%9341999%20%20The,1993%E2%80%931994).  In this guide we proceed chronologically by year/stardate, series by series. We’ll note each era’s stardates and how they’re used (e.g. TNG’s fixed “41xxx” scheme [oai_citation:3‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=%3E%20,is%20generally%20regarded%20as%20a), vs. Discovery’s year-based system [oai_citation:4‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=By%202164%2C%20Starfleet%20officers%20would,This%20scheme%20was)), and point out viewing tips or continuity notes along the way.

## 22nd Century – *Star Trek: Enterprise* (2151–2161)
Though the prompt starts at TOS, the true timeline begins earlier with **Star Trek: Enterprise**.  This series (set 2151–2161) mostly uses Earth years and simple logs (“Captain’s log, stardate 1.102” in 2151 [oai_citation:5‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=calendar%20date%20was%20cited%20in,%28Star%20Trek%3A%20Timelines)).  There was no unified stardate formula yet, so a practical approach is to watch *Enterprise* in production order. Its events (first warp flight in 2151, Enterprise’s mission, up to the Vulcan councils of 2161) precede all TOS-era stories.  (*Optional:* You could place *Enterprise* at the very start, then proceed to Discovery, SNW, etc.)

## Alternate Timeline – Kelvin Universe Films (2258–2263)
The *Star Trek* reboot films exist in a divergent timeline. For reference: *Star Trek* (2009) is set in stardate ~2258.42 [oai_citation:6‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2233%20%20,No%20Man%20Has%20Gone%20Before), *Into Darkness* (2013) at ~2259.55 [oai_citation:7‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2233%20%20,No%20Man%20Has%20Gone%20Before), and *Beyond* (2016) at 2263.2 [oai_citation:8‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2233%20%20,No%20Man%20Has%20Gone%20Before).  These all occur around the late 2250s/early 2260s in an alternate reality.  If you include them, they slot parallel to the Klingon War era (see below) but do not affect the prime timeline’s continuity.

## Mid-23rd Century – *Discovery* and *Strange New Worlds* (2256–2261)
Next comes the Federation’s mid-23rd-century timeline. *Star Trek: Discovery* Seasons 1–2 (2256–2257) and *Strange New Worlds* Seasons 1–3 (2259–2261) cover the pre-TOS Klingon War era.  Stardates here roughly track the years: e.g. Discovery’s “The Vulcan Hello” (2256) is stardate 1207.3 [oai_citation:9‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=Date%20%20Stardate%20%20Source,2%20%20190) (year 2256).  Discovery S2 continues into 2257–58, then SNW picks up in 2259. (No reliable stardate is given for every SNW episode, but they follow sequentially into 2261.)  These episodes lay the groundwork for TOS.  For example, SNW S1 starts around stardate 2259.0 and ends just before the original five-year mission.

## 23rd Century – *The Original Series* (2265–2269) and *Animated Series* (2270–2274)
In **Star Trek: The Original Series**, the Enterprise under Kirk patrols 2265–2269.  Watching by stardate largely coincides with production order, since TOS filming was roughly chronological.  The first episode of TOS (*“Where No Man Has Gone Before”*, 2265) has stardate 1312.4 [oai_citation:10‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=four%20digits%20weren%27t%20selected%20quite,in%20the%20rate%20of%20change), and the final episode (*“Turnabout Intruder”*, 2269) is ~5928.5 [oai_citation:11‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=four%20digits%20weren%27t%20selected%20quite,in%20the%20rate%20of%20change).  Overall TOS stardates span about **1000–5999** [oai_citation:12‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2265%20%201000%E2%80%931499%20%20Star,1973%E2%80%931974).  The later *Animated Series* (2270–2274) follows immediately, covering stardates ~5221–6146 [oai_citation:13‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=Tribbles%20,1974) (for example, TAS Season 1 runs 5221–5683 and Season 2 is ~6000–6146).  *Viewing tip:* TOS episodes were made out of narrative sequence – Roddenberry even joked the dates seemed random [oai_citation:14‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=four%20digits%20weren%27t%20selected%20quite,in%20the%20rate%20of%20change) [oai_citation:15‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=episode%20we%20would%20move%20the,the%20week%20after%20it%27s%203414) – but for stardate order you can treat them sequentially, adding TAS episodes at the end of 2270.

After the animated shorts, the classic movies take over.  *Star Trek: The Motion Picture* (2273) has stardates ~7410–7599 [oai_citation:16‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2273%20%207410%E2%80%937599%20%20The,2275%20%20%20133).  *The Wrath of Khan* (2285) spans ~8100–8130; *The Search for Spock* (2285) 8130–8210 [oai_citation:17‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2278%20%207818%20%20USS,1986).  *The Voyage Home* (2286) ~8300–8399 [oai_citation:18‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2285%20%208100%E2%80%938299%20%20The,1986), *The Final Frontier* (2287) ~8400–8499 [oai_citation:19‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2286%20%208300%E2%80%938399%20%20The,1991), and *The Undiscovered Country* (2293) ~9500–9999 [oai_citation:20‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2287%20%208400%E2%80%938499%20%20The,%281996%29%20%5Bflashback%20taking) (note *Generations*’ prologue also occurs in 2293).  These films continue the TOS-era timeline through the late 2290s.

## 24th Century – *The Next Generation* (2364–2370)
Jumping ahead to the 2360s, *Star Trek: The Next Generation* plays out from 2364–2370.  Its episodes were carefully tied to stardates: Season 1 uses 41000–41999, Season 2 42000–42999, up to Season 7 at 47000–47999 [oai_citation:21‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2364%20%2041000%E2%80%9341999%20%20The,1993%E2%80%931994).  In fact, the TNG production notes specified “the first two digits are always ‘41’” in Season 1 [oai_citation:22‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=%3E%20,is%20generally%20regarded%20as%20a).  So TNG’s stardates run about **41000–47999** across 2364–2370.  (For example, *“Encounter at Farpoint”* was assigned ~41153.7 in production [oai_citation:23‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=%3E%20,is%20generally%20regarded%20as%20a).)  Key continuity: none of TNG’s episodes overlap other series yet, and its stardate scheme remains consistent through the series and *Generations*.

## 24th Century – *Deep Space Nine* (2369–2375) and *Voyager* (2371–2378)
*Star Trek: Deep Space Nine* begins in 2369 (overlapping TNG’s final years) and runs through 2375. *Voyager* begins in 2371 and runs through 2378.  These overlap heavily.  In stardates, DS9’s seasons cover roughly 46000–54999 (DS9 ends in 2375) and Voyager covers ~48000–56899 by its finale [oai_citation:24‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=Q,1996).  For example, *Voyager* Season 1 (2371) spans 48000–48999 [oai_citation:25‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=Q,1995%E2%80%931996) (the pilot “Caretaker” is stardate 48068.8).  By 2373, *DS9* and *VOY* coincide with *Star Trek: First Contact* (2373, stardate 50893.5 [oai_citation:26‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2366%20%20%2043929,269), which slots between Voyager S3 and DS9 S5).  The Dominion War spans DS9 S5–S7 (2373–75) alongside *Voyager* S3–S6 (2373–77) and *First Contact*.  Then *Voyager* S7 (2377–78) ends just before *Star Trek: Nemesis* (2379, stardate 56844.9 [oai_citation:27‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2378%20%2C%20April%205%20,Before%20and%20After)).  (*Star Trek: Insurrection* – set 2375 – would fit around DS9 S7/VOY S5.)

Throughout this era, stardate notation is uniform (a five-digit number+decimal, increasing with time).  The chronology is: **TNG S1–7 (2364–70)**, then **DS9 S1–7 (2369–75)** and **Voyager S1–7 (2371–78)**, with the movies *First Contact* (2373) and *Nemesis* (2379) interspersed.  Memory Alpha confirms the sequence: TNG S1 in 2364, DS9 S1 in 2369, and Voyager S1 in 2371 [oai_citation:28‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=,according%20to%20the%20ship%27s%20computer).  Watch TNG in order, then proceed to DS9/VOY (they can be interwoven roughly by season since stardates are roughly sequential).

## Late 24th Century – *Lower Decks* (2380–2383) and *Prodigy* (2383)
After *Voyager*, we enter the late 24th century. The animated *Star Trek: Lower Decks* (set 2380 onward) covers stardates ~57000–58999 [oai_citation:29‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2378%E2%80%932379%20%2055600%E2%80%9356399%20%20A,2023).  Season 1 (2380) opens at stardate 57601.3 [oai_citation:30‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2380%20%20%2057601,Rosetta), and Seasons 2–3 (2381–83) run ~58000–58999.  These stories (on the USS *Cerritos*) take place just after the Voyager era.  *Star Trek: Prodigy* (2021) occurs in 2383; its episode “Time Amok” has a remarkably high stardate (~60712.56) [oai_citation:31‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2380%20%20%2057601,Rosetta).  In practice, one can slot *Lower Decks* after *Nemesis*/Voyager and just before *Picard*.  These series are mostly standalone comedies/adventures, but they do reference late-24th-century events (e.g. the Federation is busy rebuilding post-Dominion War).

For example, *Lower Decks* (2380s) episodes occur around stardates 57600–58999 [oai_citation:32‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2378%E2%80%932379%20%2055600%E2%80%9356399%20%20A,2023), overlapping *Early Picard* events.  The first season’s debut has stardate 57601.3 [oai_citation:33‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2380%20%20%2057601,Rosetta) (year 2380).  Meanwhile, *Prodigy*’s ship has stardates in the 60000s (the jump above 60000 is due to the writers’ numbering, see “60712.56” for 2383 [oai_citation:34‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2380%20%20%2057601,Rosetta)).  There’s no conflict here; these shows simply extend the late-24th-century timeline.

## 25th Century – *Star Trek: Picard* (2399–2401)
*Picard* leaps forward to the 2399–2401 period. Season 1 is set in 2399–2400 (stardates ~76000–76999) [oai_citation:35‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2395%20%2072000%E2%80%9372999%20%20The,2411%20%20%20160%20%282010); a key episode even shows stardate 76000+ when Picard leaves the farmhouse.  Season 2 (2401) and 3 (2401) occur around stardate 78183 [oai_citation:36‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek#:~:text=2399%20%2076000%E2%80%9376999%20%20Picard,2411%20%20%20160%20%282010).  These series come after all the above 24th-century entries.  In viewing order, Picard S1–3 should be watched after Lower Decks/Prodigy.  (Aside: *Picard* has some flashbacks and an alternate timeline, but those are contained within 2399–2404.)

## 32nd Century – *Star Trek: Discovery* (3188–3191)
Finally, the timeline jumps to the far future.  *Star Trek: Discovery* Season 3 begins in the year 3188; its opening stardate is 865211.3 [oai_citation:37‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2383%20%20%20607125,280).  Seasons 4 (3190) and 5 (3191) continue this future chronology, with stardates ~865600–865800 [oai_citation:38‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=2383%20%20%20607125,280).  This is well beyond the 24th/25th century era.  Chronologically, *Discovery* S3–S5 would come **last**.  (Short Treks like “Calypso” are 43rd century, beyond 3191, so they fall even later.)

**Quick Chronology Summary:** In practice, you would watch *Enterprise* (2151–61) first, then the 23rd-century series/films, and end with the far-future *Discovery*.  For example: Enterprise → Discovery S1–2 (2256–57) → Strange New Worlds (2259–61) → TOS & TAS (2265–74) → TOS-era movies (2273–93) → TNG (2364–70) → DS9 & Voyager (2369–78) with First Contact/Nemesis inserted → Lower Decks/Prodigy (2380s) → Picard (2399–2401) → Discovery S3–S5 (3188–91).  Throughout, note the stardate conventions: TOS stardates were loosely used [oai_citation:39‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=four%20digits%20weren%27t%20selected%20quite,in%20the%20rate%20of%20change) [oai_citation:40‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=episode%20we%20would%20move%20the,the%20week%20after%20it%27s%203414), TNG onward they were fixed by century (the “41xxx” rule) [oai_citation:41‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=%3E%20,is%20generally%20regarded%20as%20a), and by Discovery’s time they explicitly encode the year (first four digits = year) [oai_citation:42‡memory-alpha.fandom.com](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stardate#:~:text=By%202164%2C%20Starfleet%20officers%20would,This%20scheme%20was).  These markers will help you align episodes chronologically even if they aren’t listed by year.

**Potential follow-up prompts:**
1. *“Revise the guide so it flows as a coherent narrative (linking series and episodes smoothly for casual readers).”*
2. *“Emphasize the stardate system changes and story continuity, clearly explaining how dates map between series.”*
3. *“Remove any off-topic or spoiler details; focus strictly on the chronological episode order and stardate context.”*
