# Individual Episode Tracking Implementation Plan

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This plan expands the VBS viewing guide from season-level tracking to individual episode tracking with comprehensive episode information including titles, air dates, synopses, plot points, guest stars, and cross-series connections.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Maintain functional factory pattern architecture with closures for state management
- **REQ-002**: Preserve existing progress data during migration from season to episode tracking
- **REQ-003**: Support episode-level progress tracking with hierarchical progress bars (episode → season → series → era)
- **REQ-004**: Include comprehensive episode metadata: title, air date, synopsis, plot points, guest stars, connections
- **REQ-005**: Maintain performance with large episode datasets (700+ episodes across all series)
- **REQ-006**: Support both episode-level and bulk season-level marking
- **REQ-007**: Implement spoiler-free content display with progressive disclosure
- **REQ-008**: Create dedicated createEpisodeTracker factory function with closure-based state management separate from existing progress tracker
- **REQ-009**: Integrate generic EventEmitter support for type-safe episode tracking events (EpisodeTrackerEvents interface)
- **SEC-001**: Validate all episode data structures at runtime to prevent data corruption
- **CON-001**: Must work with existing LocalStorage-based progress system
- **CON-002**: UI must remain responsive on mobile devices with episode lists
- **GUD-001**: Follow self-explanatory code commenting guidelines
- **GUD-002**: Maintain TypeScript strict typing throughout
- **PAT-001**: Use immutable state patterns with controlled mutations via factory functions and generic EventEmitter integration

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1: Core Data Structure & Types

- GOAL-001: Establish episode data structure and update type system to support hierarchical tracking

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-001 | Create Episode interface in `src/modules/types.ts` with id, title, season, episode, airDate, synopsis, plotPoints, guestStars, connections fields | |  |
| TASK-002 | Add EpisodeConnection interface for cross-series episode references | |  |
| TASK-003 | Update StarTrekItem interface to include optional episodes array | |  |
| TASK-004 | Create EpisodeProgress and SeasonProgress interfaces for hierarchical progress tracking | |  |
| TASK-005 | Add sample episode data for Enterprise Season 1 in `src/data/star-trek-data.ts` (26 episodes) | |  |
| TASK-006 | Create runtime validation schemas using type guards for episode data integrity | |  |

### Implementation Phase 2: Progress System Overhaul

- GOAL-002: Update progress tracking to work at episode level while maintaining backward compatibility

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-007 | Create `src/modules/migration.ts` with functions to migrate season-level progress to episode-level | |  |
| TASK-008 | Update `createProgressTracker` in `src/modules/progress.ts` to handle episode IDs and hierarchical progress | |  |
| TASK-009 | Add `calculateSeasonProgress` and `calculateEpisodeProgress` utility functions | |  |
| TASK-010 | Update storage format in `src/modules/storage.ts` to support episode-level progress with version migration | |  |
| TASK-011 | Implement bulk operations: markSeasonWatched, markSeasonUnwatched functions | |  |
| TASK-012 | Add progress data validation and error recovery for corrupted episode progress | |  |
| TASK-013 | Create `createEpisodeTracker` factory function in new `src/modules/episodeTracker.ts` with closure-based state management | |  |
| TASK-014 | Integrate generic EventEmitter support with EpisodeTrackerEvents interface for type-safe event handling | |  |

### Implementation Phase 3: UI Components & Episode Management

- GOAL-003: Create episode-level UI components with detailed progress visualization and episode information display

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-015 | Create `src/modules/episodes.ts` factory function for episode list management and filtering | |  |
| TASK-016 | Update `createTimelineRenderer` in `src/modules/timeline.ts` to render collapsible episode lists within seasons | |  |
| TASK-017 | Add detailed progress bars showing episode completion within seasons (e.g., "8/26 episodes watched") | |  |
| TASK-018 | Create episode detail modal/expansion with synopsis, plot points, guest stars, and connections | |  |
| TASK-019 | Add episode search and filtering capabilities (by title, guest stars, plot keywords) | |  |
| TASK-020 | Implement lazy loading for episode lists to maintain performance with large datasets | |  |
| TASK-021 | Update CSS in `src/style.css` for episode list styling, progress bars, and responsive design | |  |
| TASK-022 | Add keyboard navigation support for episode lists (arrow keys, enter to toggle) | |  |

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: External episode database API (TMDB, TVDB) instead of bundled data - rejected due to offline-first requirement and data consistency needs
- **ALT-002**: Hybrid approach keeping season tracking with optional episode detail - rejected as it doesn't fully meet user requirements for episode-level progress
- **ALT-003**: Progressive enhancement starting with one series - considered for initial implementation to reduce risk
- **ALT-004**: Virtual scrolling library (react-virtualized) - rejected to maintain vanilla DOM approach, will implement custom lazy loading instead

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: Episode data collection for all Star Trek series (700+ episodes) - significant content creation effort
- **DEP-002**: May require virtual scrolling or pagination library if performance issues arise with large episode lists
- **DEP-003**: Episode synopsis and plot point data sources (Memory Alpha, official sources)
- **DEP-004**: Guest star and connection data compilation across all series

## 5. Files

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-003**: Migration tests ensuring no progress data loss during season→episode migration
- **TEST-004**: Performance tests for rendering large episode lists (100+ episodes)
- **TEST-005**: UI interaction tests for episode toggling, bulk operations, and keyboard navigation
- **TEST-006**: Storage compatibility tests ensuring backward/forward compatibility
- **TEST-007**: Search and filtering tests for episode discovery functionality
- **TEST-008**: Responsive design tests for episode lists on mobile devices

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Data migration could corrupt existing user progress - mitigated by backup/restore functionality and extensive testing
- **RISK-002**: Performance degradation with large episode lists - mitigated by lazy loading and virtual scrolling fallback
- **RISK-003**: UI complexity increase may hurt usability - mitigated by progressive disclosure and collapsible sections
- **RISK-004**: Episode data collection is massive manual effort - consider phased rollout starting with most popular series
- **RISK-005**: Breaking changes to existing modules during refactor - mitigated by maintaining factory function interfaces
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Users want episode-level granularity vs simpler season tracking
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: LocalStorage capacity sufficient for expanded episode progress data (estimated 10-50KB additional)
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Episode synopsis and plot point data can be obtained without copyright issues
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: Performance acceptable without external virtualization libraries
