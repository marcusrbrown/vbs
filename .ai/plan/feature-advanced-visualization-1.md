# Advanced VBS Features Implementation Plan

![Status: In progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20progress-yellow)

This plan implements advanced features for the VBS viewing guide including interactive D3.js timeline visualization, user preference settings, streaming service integration, and local-first architecture with service workers. This plan complements and extends [feature-episode-tracking-1.md](./feature-episode-tracking-1.md) with infrastructure and visualization enhancements.

**UPDATE (2025-08-08)**: Phase 1 migration system implementation is now **COMPLETE**! All core migration utilities (TASK-001 through TASK-012) are completed and tested with comprehensive coverage. The foundation for IndexedDB migration, version management, error handling, user preferences, theme system, adaptive storage, migration progress UI, Service Worker with background sync, and PWA capabilities is now fully in place with **12/12 tasks complete (100%)**. Phase 1 is ready for Phase 2 - Interactive Timeline Visualization.

**UPDATE (2025-08-09)**: Phase 2 D3.js timeline visualization foundation is now **SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE**! Core timeline implementation tasks (TASK-013 through TASK-015) are completed with D3.js v7.9.0 integration, comprehensive timeline data structures, factory function implementation following VBS patterns, and Star Trek chronological events dataset. Timeline visualization with zoom, pan, filtering, and export capabilities is operational with **3/8 Phase 2 tasks complete (37.5%)**. Ready to proceed with progress integration and advanced interactive features.

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Chart.js or Plotly instead of D3.js for timeline - rejected due to less customization flexibility for complex Star Trek chronology
- **ALT-002**: Real-time streaming API calls instead of caching - rejected due to rate limits and offline requirements
- **ALT-003**: Server-side streaming data aggregation - rejected to maintain local-first architecture
- **ALT-004**: Canvas-only timeline rendering - considered for performance but SVG chosen for accessibility and interaction capabilities
- **ALT-005**: External CDN for D3.js - rejected to maintain offline-first functionality
- **ALT-006**: Dexie.js instead of native IndexedDB - rejected since native IndexedDBAdapter<T> already implemented and working
- **ALT-007**: Immediate full migration instead of progressive - rejected to maintain user experience and reduce risk
- **ALT-008**: One-way migration without rollback - rejected to ensure data safety and testing capabilities

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: [feature-episode-tracking-1.md](./feature-episode-tracking-1.md) TASK-001 through TASK-006 must be completed for episode data structure
- **DEP-002**: D3.js v7+ with TypeScript definitions for timeline visualization
- **DEP-003**: Watchmode API or Streaming Availability API access with rate limiting (500-1000 requests/day)
- **DEP-004**: PatternFly Timeline library or similar for D3.js timeline base implementation
- **DEP-005**: Star Trek chronological event data compilation (major galactic events, wars, technological developments)
- **DEP-006**: Existing IndexedDBAdapter<T> and LocalStorageAdapter<T> in `src/modules/storage.ts` (already implemented)
- **DEP-007**: Existing withErrorHandling and withSyncErrorHandling utilities in `src/modules/error-handler.ts`
- **DEP-008**: Generic storage adapter pattern and createStorage utility (already implemented)

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Migration data loss during LocalStorage→IndexedDB transfer - mitigated by atomic operations, validation, and rollback capability
- **RISK-002**: IndexedDB browser compatibility on older devices - mitigated by feature detection and LocalStorage fallback
- **RISK-003**: D3.js performance with large timeline datasets may require canvas fallback - mitigated by progressive rendering and virtualization
- **RISK-004**: Streaming API rate limits could impact user experience - mitigated by aggressive caching and batch operations
- **RISK-005**: Service Worker complexity may introduce deployment issues - mitigated by feature detection and gradual rollout
- **RISK-006**: Timeline UI complexity may overwhelm users - mitigated by progressive disclosure and user preference hiding
- **RISK-007**: Streaming service API changes could break integration - mitigated by adapter pattern and multiple API support
- **RISK-008**: Migration process interruption could corrupt data - mitigated by transactional operations and integrity checks
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Users want visual timeline representation vs text-based chronology
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Streaming availability is valuable enough to justify API costs and complexity
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Local-first approach preferred over real-time server synchronization
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: D3.js learning curve acceptable for development team
- **ASSUMPTION-005**: IndexedDB storage quotas sufficient for episode and streaming data (estimated 50-100MB)
- **ASSUMPTION-006**: Users will accept one-time migration process for improved performance and capabilities
- **ASSUMPTION-007**: Existing progress data structure is compatible with IndexedDB schema design
