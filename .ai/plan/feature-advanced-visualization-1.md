# Advanced VBS Features Implementation Plan

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This plan implements advanced features for the VBS viewing guide including interactive D3.js timeline visualization, user preference settings, streaming service integration, and local-first architecture with service workers. This plan complements and extends [feature-episode-tracking-1.md](./feature-episode-tracking-1.md) with infrastructure and visualization enhancements.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Maintain functional factory pattern architecture and integrate seamlessly with episode tracking system
- **REQ-002**: Implement local-first/offline-first architecture using Service Workers and IndexedDB
- **REQ-003**: Create interactive timeline visualization using D3.js with zoom, pan, and filtering capabilities
- **REQ-004**: Add comprehensive user preference system (themes, view options, accessibility settings)
- **REQ-005**: Integrate with streaming service APIs (Watchmode/Streaming Availability API) for content availability
- **REQ-006**: Maintain performance with large datasets through virtualization and lazy loading
- **REQ-007**: Support Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities with offline caching
- **REQ-008**: Ensure cross-browser compatibility and graceful degradation for older browsers
- **SEC-001**: Secure API key management for streaming services with rate limiting protection
- **SEC-002**: Validate all external API responses and handle malicious data safely
- **CON-001**: Must integrate with existing episode tracking data structures without conflicts
- **CON-002**: Timeline visualization must work on mobile devices with touch interactions
- **CON-003**: Service Workers must not break existing functionality during deployment
- **GUD-001**: Follow self-explanatory code commenting guidelines
- **GUD-002**: Maintain TypeScript strict typing throughout all new modules
- **PAT-001**: Use local-first patterns with background synchronization for streaming data

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1: Local-First Infrastructure & User Preferences

- GOAL-001: Establish local-first architecture foundation and user preference system

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-001 | Create Service Worker with caching strategies in `public/sw.js` for app shell and episode data caching | |  |

| TASK-013 | Add responsive design and touch interactions for mobile timeline navigation | |  |
| TASK-014 | Create timeline performance optimization with canvas rendering for large datasets | |  |

### Implementation Phase 3: Streaming Service Integration

- GOAL-003: Integrate streaming availability data with background updates and local caching

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-016 | Create `src/modules/streaming-api.ts` with Watchmode API integration and rate limiting | |  |
| TASK-017 | Implement streaming availability caching in IndexedDB with expiration and background refresh | |  |
| TASK-018 | Add streaming availability UI indicators to episode lists and timeline visualization | |  |
| TASK-019 | Create geographic availability handling (US, Canada, UK regions) with user location preferences | |  |
| TASK-020 | Implement batch API operations for efficient streaming data updates | |  |
| TASK-021 | Add deep linking to streaming services (Paramount+, Netflix) with affiliate tracking support | |  |
| TASK-022 | Create streaming availability search and filtering within episode lists | |  |
| TASK-023 | Add streaming service preference settings (hide unavailable content, preferred services) | |  |

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Chart.js or Plotly instead of D3.js for timeline - rejected due to less customization flexibility for complex Star Trek chronology
- **ALT-002**: Local storage instead of IndexedDB - rejected due to size limitations and lack of query capabilities
- **ALT-003**: Real-time streaming API calls instead of caching - rejected due to rate limits and offline requirements
- **ALT-004**: Server-side streaming data aggregation - rejected to maintain local-first architecture
- **ALT-005**: Canvas-only timeline rendering - considered for performance but SVG chosen for accessibility and interaction capabilities
- **ALT-006**: External CDN for D3.js - rejected to maintain offline-first functionality

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: [feature-episode-tracking-1.md](./feature-episode-tracking-1.md) TASK-001 through TASK-006 must be completed for episode data structure
- **DEP-002**: Dexie.js library for IndexedDB abstraction and better developer experience
- **DEP-003**: D3.js v7+ with TypeScript definitions for timeline visualization
- **DEP-004**: Watchmode API or Streaming Availability API access with rate limiting (500-1000 requests/day)
- **DEP-005**: PatternFly Timeline library or similar for D3.js timeline base implementation
- **DEP-006**: Star Trek chronological event data compilation (major galactic events, wars, technological developments)

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: D3.js performance with large timeline datasets may require canvas fallback - mitigated by progressive rendering and virtualization
- **RISK-002**: Streaming API rate limits could impact user experience - mitigated by aggressive caching and batch operations
- **RISK-003**: Service Worker complexity may introduce deployment issues - mitigated by feature detection and gradual rollout
- **RISK-004**: IndexedDB browser compatibility on older devices - mitigated by localStorage fallback for essential data
- **RISK-005**: Timeline UI complexity may overwhelm users - mitigated by progressive disclosure and user preference hiding
- **RISK-006**: Streaming service API changes could break integration - mitigated by adapter pattern and multiple API support
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Users want visual timeline representation vs text-based chronology
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Streaming availability is valuable enough to justify API costs and complexity
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Local-first approach preferred over real-time server synchronization
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: D3.js learning curve acceptable for development team
- **ASSUMPTION-005**: IndexedDB storage quotas sufficient for episode and streaming data (estimated 50-100MB)
