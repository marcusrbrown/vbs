# Create Functional Composition Utilities Module

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This implementation plan creates a comprehensive functional composition utilities module (`src/utils/composition.ts`) with higher-order functions including `pipe()`, `compose()`, `curry()`, and `tap()` to enable elegant function chaining throughout the VBS codebase. The module includes a specialized `createPipeline()` helper for common data transformation patterns in search filtering, progress calculations, and UI updates, designed to integrate seamlessly with the planned generic types refactor.

- **REQ-006**: Follow TypeScript best practices and strict type checking
- **REQ-007**: Maintain ESLint compliance with @bfra.me/eslint-config
- **REQ-008**: Enable elegant chaining for search filtering, progress calculations, and UI updates
- **SEC-001**: Composition utilities must maintain error handling and data validation patterns
- **SEC-002**: Prevent memory leaks in closure-based compositions
- **CON-001**: Must integrate seamlessly with planned generic types refactor (EventEmitter<T>, storage utilities)
- **CON-002**: Performance overhead must be minimal for existing data transformation operations
- **CON-003**: Deep composition chains must remain debuggable and maintainable
- **CON-004**: Support future IndexedDB migration and episode-level tracking features
- **GUD-001**: Follow established functional factory implementation patterns
- **GUD-002**: Provide comprehensive TypeScript documentation with usage examples
- **GUD-003**: Use immutable data operations throughout composition chains
- **PAT-001**: Implement left-to-right pipe() for intuitive data flow visualization
- **PAT-002**: Support partial application via curry() for reusable predicates and transformations
- **PAT-003**: Enable side effects in pipelines via tap() for logging and callbacks

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use external functional library (Ramda, Lodash/FP) - rejected to maintain zero dependencies and VBS philosophy
- **ALT-002**: Create simple helper functions without composition - rejected as it doesn't provide function chaining benefits
- **ALT-003**: Full functional programming rewrite of existing modules - rejected as too disruptive to current architecture
- **ALT-004**: Implement only pipe() without other composition utilities - rejected as it limits functional programming capabilities
- **ALT-005**: Use native array methods only - rejected as it doesn't provide reusable composition patterns
