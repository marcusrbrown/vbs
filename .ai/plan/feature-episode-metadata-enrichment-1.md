# Episode Metadata Enrichment System Implementation Plan

![Status: In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Progress-yellow)

This plan extends the existing VBS Service Worker to implement a comprehensive episode metadata enrichment system that leverages background sync capabilities to fetch detailed episode information from Memory Alpha, TMDB, and other official Star Trek sources. The system builds on the completed episode tracking and advanced visualization features to provide rich episode metadata while maintaining the offline-first, local-first architecture.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Extend existing Service Worker (sw.js) with background sync for metadata enrichment without breaking current caching strategies
- **REQ-002**: Integrate with Memory Alpha, TMDB, and other official Star Trek sources using rate-limited API calls
- **REQ-003**: Store enriched episode metadata in IndexedDB using current EpisodeTrackerInstance and storage adapter patterns
- **REQ-004**: Expand StarTrekItem interface to include comprehensive episode metadata (air dates, plot summaries, guest stars, production codes, director/writer credits)
- **REQ-005**: Implement rate-limited API integrations with proper error handling using established withErrorHandling utilities
- **REQ-006**: Create CLI scripts for bulk data validation and testing (scripts/validate-episode-data.ts)
- **REQ-007**: Provide debug panels accessible through existing preferences system for content verification and manual refresh
- **REQ-008**: Respect user preferences for data usage and work offline-first with graceful degradation
- **REQ-009**: Integrate seamlessly with current episode progress tracking and streaming availability systems
- **REQ-010**: Maintain functional factory architecture with TypeScript strict compliance
- **REQ-011**: Provide comprehensive Vitest testing coverage for all new metadata functionality
- **REQ-012**: Implement progressive enhancement - metadata enrichment should enhance but not block core functionality
- **REQ-013**: Support bulk metadata updates with progress tracking and user cancellation capabilities
- **SEC-001**: Secure API key management for TMDB and other services with proper rate limiting to avoid account suspension
- **SEC-002**: Validate all external API responses and sanitize metadata content to prevent XSS or data corruption
- **SEC-003**: Implement proper CORS handling and respect robots.txt for Memory Alpha scraping
- **CON-001**: Must build on completed episode tracking system without breaking existing progress data
- **CON-002**: Background sync must not impact app performance or drain device battery excessively
- **CON-003**: Metadata storage must not exceed reasonable IndexedDB quotas (target <100MB total)
- **CON-004**: All API integrations must handle network failures gracefully and work offline
- **GUD-001**: Follow self-explanatory code commenting guidelines throughout metadata enrichment system
- **GUD-002**: Maintain TypeScript strict typing with comprehensive interfaces for all metadata structures
- **GUD-003**: Use existing generic storage adapter and EventEmitter patterns for consistency
- **PAT-001**: Implement queue-based background processing with priority levels (new episodes > older episodes)
- **PAT-002**: Use functional composition utilities for metadata transformation pipelines
- **PAT-003**: Follow progressive disclosure patterns for metadata display (basic info → detailed info → full metadata)

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Static metadata bundling instead of dynamic enrichment - rejected due to maintenance burden and storage limitations
- **ALT-002**: Server-side metadata aggregation service - rejected to maintain local-first architecture and user privacy
- **ALT-003**: Single data source (TMDB only) instead of multiple sources - rejected due to incomplete Star Trek coverage
- **ALT-004**: Real-time API calls instead of background sync - rejected due to performance impact and offline requirements
- **ALT-005**: WebAssembly for metadata processing - considered for performance but rejected due to complexity and browser compatibility
- **ALT-006**: GraphQL federation for multiple API sources - rejected to avoid additional complexity and maintain simple REST patterns
- **ALT-007**: Blockchain/IPFS for decentralized metadata - rejected as over-engineering for current requirements

- **RISK-002**: Memory Alpha structure changes could break scraping - mitigated by robust parsing and fallback strategies
- **RISK-003**: Large metadata storage could exceed browser quotas - mitigated by smart caching and cleanup policies
- **RISK-004**: Background sync could impact app performance - mitigated by careful resource management and user controls
- **RISK-005**: Data quality inconsistencies between sources - mitigated by validation, scoring, and user review capabilities
- **RISK-006**: Service Worker updates could break metadata functionality - mitigated by versioning and graceful degradation
- **RISK-007**: Legal issues with data scraping or API usage - mitigated by compliance with terms of service and robots.txt
- **RISK-008**: User privacy concerns with external API calls - mitigated by clear preferences and local-first design
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Users want detailed episode metadata vs simple tracking - validated through user feedback and progressive enhancement
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: IndexedDB quota sufficient for comprehensive metadata storage - estimated 50-100MB for full Star Trek catalog
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Service Worker Background Sync API availability across target browsers - graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
